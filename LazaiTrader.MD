## ü§ñ The Trading Strategy Explained

### What is the Martingale Strategy?
Martingale is a trading strategy that:
- **Buys more** when prices go down (hoping they'll recover)
- **Sells more** when prices go up (taking profits)
- **Increases trade size** after each consecutive trade in the same direction (1.5x multiplier)

### Example in Action:
1. **Price drops 5%** ‚Üí Bot buys $10 worth of tgMetis
2. **Price drops another 5%** ‚Üí Bot buys $15 worth (1.5x previous)
3. **Price drops again** ‚Üí Bot buys $22.50 worth
4. **Price recovers** ‚Üí Bot sells everything for profit

### Your Settings Control:
- **Trade Percentage**: How much of your wallet to use per trade
- **Trigger Percentage**: How much price must change to trigger a trade  
- **Multiplier**: Fixed at 1.5x for consecutive trades
- **Max/Min Amounts**: Safety limits on trade sizes
