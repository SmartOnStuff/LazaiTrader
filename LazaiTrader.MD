## ü§ñ The Martingale Strategy Explained

### What is Martingale?
Martingale is a trading strategy that:
- **Buys more** when prices go down (hoping they'll recover)
- **Sells more** when prices go up (taking profits)
- **Increases trade size** after each consecutive trade in the same direction (1.5x multiplier)

### Example in Action:
1. **Price drops 5%** ‚Üí Bot buys $10 worth of tgMetis
2. **Price drops another 5%** ‚Üí Bot buys $15 worth (1.5x previous)
3. **Price drops again** ‚Üí Bot buys $22.50 worth
4. **Price recovers** ‚Üí Bot sells everything for profit

### Your Settings Control:
- **Trade Percentage**: How much of your wallet to use per trade
- **Trigger Percentage**: How much price must change to trigger a trade  
- **Multiplier**: Fixed at 1.5x for consecutive trades
- **Max/Min Amounts**: Safety limits on trade sizes

## ‚öôÔ∏è Strategy Tips

### For Conservative Traders:
- Choose "Conservative Strategy" option
- Keep default settings or reduce trade/trigger percentages slightly
- This gives you more frequent trades with lower risk per trade

### For Aggressive Traders:
- Choose "Aggressive Strategy" option
- Consider increasing maximum trade amounts
- This means fewer but potentially more profitable trades

### Understanding Risk:
- **Lower trigger percentage** = More frequent trades (more sensitive to price changes)
- **Higher trade percentage** = Larger individual trades
- **Higher max amount** = Allows for bigger trades when you have large balances
- **1.5x multiplier** = Each consecutive trade in same direction is 50% larger

## üîê Safety & Security

### During Testing Phase:
- **No Real Money**: All trading uses test tokens
- **Admin Managed**: Test wallets are controlled by the system
- **Safe Environment**: Hyperion testnet is a practice network
- **Withdrawal Disabled**: Focus is on testing strategies, not moving funds

### For Future Production:
- **Your Own Wallets**: You'll control your own funds
- **Real Trading**: On the actual Metis network
- **Enhanced Security**: Confidential computing and public audit logs
