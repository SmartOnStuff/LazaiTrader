# LazaiTrader Disclaimer

**Last Updated: December 2025**

---

## IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ THIS DISCLAIMER CAREFULLY BEFORE USING LAZAITRADER

---

## 1. BETA SOFTWARE WARNING

**LazaiTrader is currently in BETA testing phase.** This means:

- The software is **experimental and under active development**
- Features may be incomplete, unstable, or change without notice
- Bugs, errors, and unexpected behavior may occur
- The platform may experience downtime or service interruptions
- **You should only use funds you can afford to lose entirely**

By using LazaiTrader during the beta phase, you acknowledge that you are participating in testing experimental software and accept all associated risks.

---

## 2. NO SMART CONTRACT AUDIT

**CRITICAL: The smart contracts powering LazaiTrader have NOT been audited by any third-party security firm.**

This means:

- Undiscovered vulnerabilities may exist in the contract code
- Bugs could potentially result in loss of funds
- The contracts have not been independently verified for security
- Standard security best practices may not have been fully implemented

We intend to pursue professional security audits in the future, but until such audits are completed and published, users must understand they are interacting with unaudited code.

**Recommendation:** Only deposit amounts you are fully prepared to lose.

---

## 3. TRADING AND FINANCIAL RISKS

### 3.1 Automated Trading Risks

LazaiTrader employs automated trading strategies that carry significant risks:

- **Market Volatility:** Cryptocurrency markets are extremely volatile. Prices can move dramatically in short periods, potentially resulting in substantial losses.

- **Strategy Limitations:** The Martingale-inspired trading strategy used by LazaiTrader can amplify losses during extended market movements in one direction. There is no guarantee of profit.

- **Execution Risk:** Trades may not execute at expected prices due to slippage, network congestion, or liquidity issues.

- **No Guaranteed Returns:** Past performance does not indicate future results. Automated trading does not guarantee profits and can result in total loss of deposited funds.

### 3.2 No Financial Advice

**LazaiTrader does not provide financial, investment, tax, or legal advice.**

- The platform is a software tool, not a financial advisor
- Trading parameters and strategies are set by users at their own discretion
- We make no recommendations about what to trade, when to trade, or how much to trade
- Users are solely responsible for their trading decisions
- Consult qualified financial professionals before making investment decisions

### 3.3 Not an Investment Product

LazaiTrader is software that facilitates automated trading. It is not:

- A managed investment fund
- A financial advisory service
- A guaranteed return product
- An investment scheme or offering

---

## 4. NON-CUSTODIAL ARCHITECTURE

### 4.1 User Control of Funds

LazaiTrader operates on a **non-custodial model**:

- Users deploy their own Smart Contract Wallets (SCWs)
- All funds remain in user-controlled smart contracts
- LazaiTrader never takes custody of user funds
- Withdrawals can only be sent to the user's registered wallet address

### 4.2 User Responsibility

Because the platform is non-custodial:

- **You are solely responsible for your wallet security**
- **You are responsible for safeguarding your private keys**
- **Lost private keys cannot be recovered by LazaiTrader**
- **We cannot reverse, cancel, or modify transactions**
- **We cannot recover funds sent to incorrect addresses**

---

## 5. SMART CONTRACT AND BLOCKCHAIN RISKS

### 5.1 Immutability

Blockchain transactions are irreversible. Once a transaction is confirmed:

- It cannot be undone or modified
- Funds sent to wrong addresses cannot be recovered
- Erroneous trades cannot be reversed

### 5.2 Smart Contract Risks

Interacting with smart contracts carries inherent risks:

- **Code Vulnerabilities:** Bugs or exploits may exist
- **Upgrade Risks:** Contract upgrades may introduce new issues
- **Dependency Risks:** Contracts depend on external protocols that may fail
- **Gas Costs:** Transaction fees may be higher than expected

### 5.3 Network Risks

Blockchain network issues may affect the platform:

- Network congestion may delay or prevent trades
- Hard forks or network upgrades may cause disruptions
- Validator/miner issues may affect transaction processing

---

## 6. THIRD-PARTY DEPENDENCIES

LazaiTrader relies on third-party services that are outside our control:

### 6.1 Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)

- Trades are executed on third-party DEXs (e.g., HerculesDEX)
- DEX liquidity, availability, and security are not controlled by LazaiTrader
- DEX smart contracts may have their own vulnerabilities
- Slippage and price impact depend on DEX liquidity

### 6.2 Price Oracles and APIs

- Price data is sourced from external APIs
- Incorrect or delayed price data may trigger unintended trades
- API downtime may prevent trade execution
- Price manipulation on source exchanges could affect trading

### 6.3 Blockchain Infrastructure

- We rely on RPC providers for blockchain connectivity
- Infrastructure failures may cause service disruptions
- We are not responsible for blockchain network issues

### 6.4 Telegram Platform

- LazaiTrader operates via Telegram
- Telegram service issues may affect platform accessibility
- We are not responsible for Telegram's availability or security
