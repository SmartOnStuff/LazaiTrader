# LazaiTrader User Guide

## What is LazaiTrader?
LazaiTrader is an intelligent trading assistant that works through Telegram. It automatically trades cryptocurrency for you using proven strategies on the Hyperion testnet. Think of it as your personal AI trader that never sleeps!

## üéØ How It Works (Simple Explanation)
1. **You Get a Wallet**: When you start, you receive a funded test wallet
2. **You Set Your Strategy**: Tell the bot how you want to trade (conservative vs aggressive)
3. **AI Does the Trading**: The bot watches prices and makes trades automatically
4. **You Get Updates**: Receive real-time notifications about your trades
5. **You Can Win Prizes**: Top performers share up to $500 in rewards!
6. **Share & Learn**: Contribute to the Strategy Vault and get AI-powered suggestions

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Step 1: Join the Bot
- Click the LazaiTrader bot link or scan the QR code: https://t.me/LazaiTrader_bot
- Send `/start` to begin
- You'll automatically receive a funded test wallet with:
  - 100 tgUSDC
  - 10,000,000 tgMetis
  - 0.1 testgETH

### Step 2: Configure Your Strategy
- Send `/config` to set up your trading preferences
- Choose between two simple options:
  - **üõ°Ô∏è Conservative Strategy**: Lower risk, smaller profits (5% trade amount, 5% trigger, $20 max)
  - **‚ö° Aggressive Strategy**: Higher risk, larger potential gains (20% trade amount, 15% trigger, $100 max)

### Step 3: Fine-tune Your Settings  
- **Trade Percentage**: How much of your balance to use per trade (adjustable ¬±20%)
- **Trigger Percentage**: Price change needed to execute trades (adjustable ¬±20%)
- **Maximum Amount**: Safety limit on individual trade sizes (adjustable ¬±20%)
- **Multiplier**: Fixed at 1.5x for consecutive trades
- **Minimum Amount**: Fixed at $0

### Step 4: Choose Your Trading Pair
Currently available on testnet:
- **gMetis-USDC**: Trade the popular gMetis meme token from Metis Andromeda
- **ETH-USDC**: Trade Ethereum with different market dynamics

*More pairs will be available on mainnet*

### Step 5: Start Trading!
- Once configured, your AI trader starts working immediately
- You'll receive notifications whenever trades happen
- Check your progress anytime with `/myconfig`

## üí∞ Your Test Wallet

**Starting Balance:**
- 100 tgUSDC (like $100 USD)
- 10,000,000 tgMetis (test gMetis tokens)
- 0.1 testgETH (test Ethereum tokens)

**What This Means:**
- These are test tokens on the Hyperion testnet (practice network)
- No real money is at risk during testing
- Your wallet address: Use `/wallet` or `/address` to see it anytime

## ü§ñ The Trading Strategy Explained

### What is the Martingale Strategy?
Martingale is a trading strategy that:
- **Buys more** when prices go down (hoping they'll recover)
- **Sells more** when prices go up (taking profits)
- **Increases trade size** after each consecutive trade in the same direction (1.5x multiplier)

### Example in Action:
1. **Price drops 5%** ‚Üí Bot buys $10 worth of tgMetis
2. **Price drops another 5%** ‚Üí Bot buys $15 worth (1.5x previous)
3. **Price drops again** ‚Üí Bot buys $22.50 worth
4. **Price recovers** ‚Üí Bot sells everything for profit

### Your Settings Control:
- **Trade Percentage**: How much of your wallet to use per trade
- **Trigger Percentage**: How much price must change to trigger a trade  
- **Multiplier**: Fixed at 1.5x for consecutive trades
- **Max/Min Amounts**: Safety limits on trade sizes

```

## Martingale Trading Strategy

### Algorithm Logic

**Buy Signal**: When TESTgMetis price drops by `trigger_percentage`:
- Buy `trade_percentage` of available TESTgUSDC
- For consecutive drops, multiply trade size by `multiplier`

**Sell Signal**: When TESTgMetis price rises by `trigger_percentage`:
- Sell `trade_percentage` of available TESTgMetis  
- For consecutive rises, multiply trade size by `multiplier`

### Parameters

- `trade_percentage`: Base percentage of wallet to trade (0.1 = 10%)
- `trigger_percentage`: Price change threshold (0.02 = 2%)
- `max_amount`: Maximum trade value in TESTgUSDC
- `minimum_amount`: Minimum trade value in TESTgUSDC
- `multiplier`: Factor for consecutive trade size increases
- `decimal`: Price precision for logging

### Trade Execution Flow

1. **Price Monitoring**: Fetch current TESTgMetis price from Andromeda
2. **Oracle Update**: Update Hyperion oracle with latest price
3. **Trigger Check**: Compare current price vs base price
4. **Trade Calculation**: Calculate trade amount with multiplier logic
5. **Wallet Whitelisting**: Add user wallet to DEX whitelist
6. **Trade Execution**: Execute swap on DEX contract
7. **Logging**: Record trade details and update base price
8. **Notification**: Send Telegram notification to user

## API Integration

### DexScreener API
- **Endpoint**: `https://api.dexscreener.com/latest/dex/pairs/metis/{pair_address}`
- **Purpose**: Fetch real-time TESTgMetis price from Metis Andromeda
- **Rate Limit**: Built-in rate limiting (3-5 calls/second)

### Smart Contract Calls

#### Oracle Price Update
```python
dex.functions.setPrices(price_gmetis_to_usdc, price_usdc_to_gmetis)
```

#### Trade Execution
```python
# 1. Approve token spending
token.functions.approve(dex_address, amount)

# 2. Execute swap
dex.functions.swap(token_in_address, amount_in)
```

## Logging & Monitoring

### Log Files

- `logs/trading_main.log`: Successful operations
- `logs/trading_errors.log`: Error tracking
- `logs/{symbol1}_{symbol2}_{userID}.csv`: Price data per trading pair
- `logs/{symbol1}_{symbol2}_{userID}_trades.csv`: Trade history

### Trade Notification Format

## Security Considerations

### Testing Phase Security
- Admin-controlled wallets with pre-funded balances
- Simulation mode for safe testing
- Rate limiting to prevent RPC abuse

### Production Phase Security  
- Confidential Virtual Machine (CVM) with Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)
- User-controlled wallets without admin access
- Infrastructure-as-code deployment
- Public server logs for transparency
- Open-source smart contracts

### Private Key Management
- Store `wallets.json` securely with restricted permissions
- Never commit private keys to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration

Executes trade on DEX contract.

**Parameters:**
- `w3`: Web3 instance  
- `base_asset`: Base asset symbol
- `quote_asset`: Quote asset symbol
- `action`: "BUY" or "SELL"
- `quantity`: Trade quantity
- `user_data`: User information dict

**Returns:** Dict with transaction details

#### `get_price(base_asset, quote_asset)`
Fetches current price for trading pair.

**Returns:** Tuple of (date_str, time_str, price)

### Rate Limiting

Built-in decorators for API and RPC rate limiting:
- `@rate_limit(calls_per_second=3)` for RPC calls
- `@rate_limit(calls_per_second=5)` for API calls

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Connection Errors**
- Verify RPC_URL is accessible
- Check network connectivity
- Validate CHAIN_ID matches network

**Transaction Failures**  
- Ensure sufficient gas funds in wallets
- Verify token contract addresses
- Check DEX contract permissions

**Configuration Errors**
- Validate JSON syntax in config files
- Ensure all required fields are present
- Verify address format (checksum)

**Price Feed Issues**
- Check DexScreener API accessibility
- Verify pair address in API URL
- Monitor rate limiting

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check configuration validity
python -c "import json; print(json.load(open('config/config.json')))"

# Test Web3 connection
python -c "
from web3 import Web3
w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider('https://hyperion-testnet.metisdevops.link'))
print('Connected:', w3.is_connected())
"

# Validate addresses
python -c "
from web3 import Web3
addr = '0x4704759E4a426b29615e4841B092357460925eFf'
print('Checksum:', Web3.to_checksum_address(addr))
"
```
